						<h2>Radically Transformed</h2>
						
						
						<p>
						  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Before I attempt to write about evangelism, I believe it is necessary to define a phrase which has overtaken my spiritual conversations lately. What does it mean to live a life which is radically transformed by the Lordship of Jesus Christ? I cannot hope to fit this idea in its entirety into any written form, but I will try to break it down into some of its necessary parts and paint a picture of what it might look like in my context. A number of books listed at the bottom of this article have helped me arrive at my current conclusions and you can skip this tiny article if you pick them up instead.
						</p><p>
						<u>1: Lordship of Christ</u>
						</p><p>
						  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The theology of the Lordship of Christ runs deep in my Reformed teaching. I am a poor academic, but I can repeat the little I have remembered. When the whole story of scripture is seen at once, vast patterns appear and dance. We know that Christ is king from these reverberating themes in scripture which center on Christ's resurrection and echo out to the first words spoken in Genesis and the final words spoken in Revelation. I can only try to paint a moment of this dance and hope you have seen the same.
						</p><p>
						  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Christ is the creator and upholder of creation, the one who leads and saves and shelters his people, and the king who will return to cast out death and hell. He is the one who sits on David's throne and is seated at God's right hand in glory. His Kingdom existed partially in Old Testament Israel where a man after God's own heart reigned over God's chosen people in the Promised Land. His Kingdom exists now as the Church under Christ's Lordship as He reigns in our hearts and over whatever small piece of earth we work to redeem. He will reign in full when he returns at the End and all people praise him forever in the New Kingdom where Heaven and Earth are reunited under him. Christ himself, when he walked the earth, called his kingdom the discovery of hidden treasure, the growth of fruitful crops, the leaven in rising dough, the sorting of good from evil, the gracious and just master, the expectation of a returning king.
						</p><p>
						  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I have often been encouraged by the vague thought that I am merely a character in someone else's fairytale. The story we live often feels like a constant thread of pointless toil until we die. We, brothers and sisters in Christ, now inhabit the space between the brokenness and God, and our every action is either directed towards our own lordship and ultimate destruction, or death to ourselves and worship of Christ. This truth is more real and present now than the chair I am sitting on. My thread is woven into someone else's tapestry. The fairytale is reality.
						</p><p>
						<u>2: Radically transformed</u>
						</p><p>
						  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; True knowledge or experience of Christ as King always leads to transformation. We see it in the woman at the well. We see it in the parable of the sower. We see it in the book of James, Paul's life, and a thousand other places in scripture. When a person comes to the conclusion that Christ should be their life-ruler it changes their life. They see the world differently.
						</p><p>
						  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Suddenly, this planet is not merely something to be taken from and used, but, in Chesterton's words, she is our sister. Our family, friends, and nonchristian neighbors are not merely to be managed or controlled (in love or in hatred); they are who Thomas Merton saw shining like the sun, beautiful beyond our wildest dreams. God is more than an owner to serve or a master to please, but a Father who we love and who loves us. And his Word is a light unto our feet, the delight of our hearts, the instruction which we follow.
						</p><p>
						  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sanctification is made of both sudden change and slow process. It would be inappropriate to imply that all these heart changes come in a moment of true conversion. I am writing about changes still in progress in my own heart. It would be equally inappropriate to command obedience as an end. Our goal must not be tainted by the proposition that we can earn the Kingdom. We should not be surprised when our christian walk is marked by backsliding and doubt. Consider Martha or the Apostle Peter. However, the overall trajectory of our hearts is turned homeward towards Christ by being turned over to Christ. As our love for Christ increases we have no choice but to increase in our obedience and faith.
						</p><p>
						<u>3: Living a life</u>
						</p><p>
						  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It is vital, as we worship God and act in response, that we do not try to remove ourselves from this world before the proper time. Some christians have supported the idea of the christian commune where we can finally be free from the negative impact the world has on our faith. Others have argued for ascetic monasticism to separate ourselves body and soul from the world in pursuit of heavenly things. Both of these (in their extremes) try to sever our connection with this world in preparation for the next one. I see three reasons why this is a bad idea.
						</p><p>
						  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; First, we miss the opportunity to invest deeply in the types built into the present age. It may be that some are called to immediate radical removal from secular commerce or human pleasure or broken relationships, but most of us learn hard truths about God and ourselves through the redemption of things which pass away.
						</p><p>
						  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Second, if we are to be God's partial kingdom in preparation for the next, we must act now as though God's kingdom is really here. If God's coming kingdom is physical (as it was in the Garden and seems to be in John's Revelation) then we must steward the physicality of this world. If God's kingdom involves oneness of people, language, and culture then we must not isolate ourselves from other peoples.
						</p><p>
						  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Third, if we isolate ourselves from the world, we run the risk of missing the Great Commission. Sure, we can produce pure art and live purified lives untainted by our nonchristian neighbor, but our neighbor will never have the opportunity to live a life tainted by Christ's transformation in our hearts.
						</p><p>
						<u>In Conclusion</u>
						</p><p>
						  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We are called to worship Christ as our King. This worship will change our lives. Our lives must be lived within reach of our neighbors. This is the context into which my thoughts have turned to evangelism, and it is the backbone of the conversation which is ensuing. But honestly, the books I read are far better than what I have written here!
						</p><hr><p>
						<u>Inspiration</u>
						</p><p>
						  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; These are the books that have moved me towards these conclusions. I will attempt to list them in climactic order: Gospel Centered Youth Ministry edited by C. Cole and J. Nielson, Identity Driven Design by Brendan Wu (This work was written by a friend in his senior year of college; If you intend to read it, you will probably need to contact the author through me), Adorning the Dark by Andrew Peterson, Habits of Grace by David Mathis, Mere Christianity by C. S. Lewis, Orthodoxy by G. K. Chesterton, Till We Have Faces by C. S. Lewis, The Provocative Church by Graham Tomlin, and The Bible by God through a number of incredible individuals.

						<h2>Poem: Why Write</h2>
						
						<p>
						When an insect beats its wings  <br>
						  On the far side of the world  <br>
						Or a lonely child sings  <br>
						  In the shadows growing cold,
						</p>
						<p>
						I don’t know the stories end,  <br>
						  Just the middle of the tale,  <br>
						But I know my winged friend  <br>
						  Can begin a mighty gale.
						</p>
						<p>
						Noone truly sings alone  <br>
						  Lest they leave the One who hears,  <br>
						And the most enduring tone  <br>
						  We must sing to our own ears.
						</p>
						<p>
						So sing on and never cease  <br>
						  When it seems noone is there.  <br>
						Do not hinder thought’s release.  <br>
						  Give the butterfly the air.

						<h2>Poem: My Truest Friend</h2>
						
						<p>
						I lay at sundown all alone  <br>
						&nbsp;&nbsp;  With wintery wind upon my face  <br>
						Among the stony artifacts  <br>
						&nbsp;&nbsp;  That sin has taught me to embrace  <br>
						And lean upon for joy and hope  <br>
						&nbsp;&nbsp;  And warmth and life for frozen bones.  <br>
						I search for life inside of death  <br>
						&nbsp;&nbsp;  By squeezing polished, cold tombstones.  
						</p>
						<p>
						Where fled the warmth, and where the life,  <br>
						&nbsp;&nbsp;  The love of beauty, not of death?  <br>
						What has my tender heart become?  <br>
						&nbsp;&nbsp;  What happened to my human breath?  <br>
						This icy, bleak, and wretched stone  <br>
						&nbsp;&nbsp;  Was once a soft and beating thing.  <br>
						I've felt deep pain and sorrow known  <br>
						&nbsp;&nbsp;  Because of human flesh within,  <br>
						But now I coldly hold my chest  <br>
						&nbsp;&nbsp;  Embracing what I now know best  <br>
						And in this dusky starlight hold  <br>
						&nbsp;&nbsp;  The gravestone lying in my breast.  
						</p>
						<p>
						I lay with death, caressing still  <br>
						&nbsp;&nbsp;  Damnation as my truest friend,  <br>
						When sudden daylight I beheld  <br>
						&nbsp;&nbsp;  And lies in darkness met their end.  <br>
						The dawn burst out across the knoll,  <br>
						&nbsp;&nbsp;  Burned off the shrouds of mist, revealed  <br>
						My frozen body, and gave life.  <br>
						&nbsp;&nbsp;  Beside still pools my heart was healed.  <br>
						I stood awake, disgraced, ashamed  <br>
						&nbsp;&nbsp;  Of all my wayward hopes exposed.  <br>
						I merit not my newfound grace.  <br>
						&nbsp;&nbsp;  My heart was hard. My eyes were closed.  
						</p>
						<p>
						I seek no longer empty night.  <br>
						&nbsp;&nbsp;I seek no stones for my delight.  <br>
						Sun shines on me, once wretched, lost,  <br>
						&nbsp;&nbsp;And makes me now to walk in light.  <br>
						When twilight falls with frozen breath  <br>
						&nbsp;&nbsp;It often finds me courting death,   <br>
						But dawn arrives, my soul to mend,  <br>
						&nbsp;&nbsp;And light is now my truest friend.

						<h2>Contentment</h2>
						
						<p>
							&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Several months ago, after a brief conversation on the topic, I was asked to write an article on contentment. At the time I did not think myself fit to write it. I am a visionary: I find it easier to think on what the world should look like than on how to get it there. In many ways humanity is broken and hurting, and knowing this often leaves me discontented and angry. My accidental or deliberate participation in pain only feeds my discontent. Far from solving the problems of the world, I am unable to shake the problem in my own heart. Regardless, perhaps out of the belief that I really can see the world on the other side, I have written this article.
							<br>
							&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Many people today for many good reasons are striving for contentment. I say striving because in the people in whom I have seen this desire most profoundly (the most obvious being myself), I have also seen a sort of frenzy about getting somewhere. Think of the girl who throws away her former life and dogma to achieve something she calls emotional health. The man who delves deeper and deeper into unwise romances in search of the one that will make him happy. The woman who is casting about for community, always hoping the next circle she joins will love her enough. The man who gives money to a stranger only because he needs to feel that he is still philanthropic. All of us know all too well the feeling of discontent, and I would venture to guess that most of us think of contentment as something we used to have or something we hope to have soon, at least as soon as that elusive destination is reached.
							<br>
							&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Most definitions of contentment relate it directly to satisfaction. A woman who is satisfied with the fit and color of her boots is contented with her boots. Fundamentally, she does not want to change them into some other boots.
							<br>
							&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Unfortunately, when applied to the larger aspects of the human experience, this definition paints a bleak picture. I am a visionary. How can I be satisfied while people suffer? How can I be satisfied while causing suffering? Dissatisfied with the definition of contentment, I looked to its opposite.
							<br>
							&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Discontent takes on two slightly different meanings. First, if discontent is the opposite of contentment, we can call a discontented man a dissatisfied man. A man who is not satisfied with the size or shape of his hat is discontented with his hat. Note that this definition does not describe the desire to change the size or shape of his hat in any specific way; it merely describes a dissatisfaction with the way it is currently.
							<br>
							&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Second, and more interestingly, we can call a discontented man a man who restlessly seeks change—in other words, a visionary. This man is more than dissatisfied: he has a definitive vision for the future. He actively wants to see his hat made right, and he knows what that means. But does this consign me, as a visionary, to lifelong discontent? Is there any hope for visionaries seeking contentment?
							<br>
							&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At this point a thought dawned on me. It was really quite simple and, ironically, encouraging: I don’t deserve anything. The contented woman may be able to picture better shoes, but she is still happy to have the ones she wears. The contented man certainly knows that better hats exist, but he is grateful for the one on his head. They possess a positive gratitude for the things they have, and gratitude, not satisfaction, is the key to contentedness. Any man or woman who strives for any goal may find momentary satisfaction, but people will never find contentment until they choose to be thankful for what they have found. In other words, striving for fulfillment breeds dissatisfaction, while gratitude breeds true fulfillment.
							<br>
							&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This must be taken at least one step further. Our secondary definitions of contentment and discontent are no longer opposites. Because of this, contentment and discontent can be cultivated together. A farmer may be content with his fields while constantly seeking growth, and a mother may love her children while seeking to change them. When confronted by the pain in the world and in our lives, gratitude supplants hopeless striving while a clear vision drives improvement. In the end, like gardeners and stewards, we must love the world while seeking to change it.
							<br>
							&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I am content that my life is a good gift that I do not deserve. As long as I am mindful of this, I will be a grateful visionary.
